# spinnaker-dev

Codebase developed at tha SpiNNaker workshop.The workshop is aimed at two groups of researchers: developers of spiking neural networks for computational neuroscience and robotics applications; and developers of new applications. To enable this we have consciously divided the workshop into two (non-overlapping) tracks. The five day workshop contained a mix of lectures and hands-on labs using the SpiNNaker hardware. Teaching was supported by printed overheads and lab manuals.
